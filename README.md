# Vroom
The app that keeps your car running!

## Design Phase
Design of Vroom is being done in Sketch and exported to this github for easy access throughout the team. 
Please pull the repository and reference the exports/assets folders for completed designs.
If you wish to collaborate a trial or license of Sketch is necessary to do so.

## Development Phase 
## Layout
Always begin the file with any imports that you might need for that component. Include the following comment at the top:

```javascript
/*
 * Import all the necessary components for this page.
 * Please delete components that aren't used.
 */
```

Each import area of the component must be in the following order with examples/

```javascript
// Global Requirements
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// Components
import {
  View,
} from 'react-native';
import Animation from 'lottie-react-native';

// Files Needed
import revi from '../../../assets/animations/revi-hi.json';
```

Above a major chunk of code, defined as a function, large variable, constant, or style; use the following comment style:

```javascript
/*
 * <Type of Code Block>: <Name of Code Block>
 * Author: <Author Name>
 *
 * Purpose: <Short blurb on what the code is supposed to do>
 * 
 * @param: <any parameters passed into a method>
 * @return: <the return type of a method>
 * TODO: <anything left to do, repeat if necessary, one for each task>
 */
```
