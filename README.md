# Vroom
The app that keeps your car running!

## Design Phase
Design of Vroom is being done in Sketch and exported to this github for easy access throughout the team. 
Please pull the repository and reference the exports/assets folders for completed designs.
If you wish to collaborate a trial or license of Sketch is necessary to do so.

## Development Phase
Currently we are using React Native to build our app for iOS and Android. We are using Firebase to store data.
